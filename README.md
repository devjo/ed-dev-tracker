Elite Dangerous DevTracker
==========================
Adds a dev-tracker to the Frontier Developments Elite Dangerous forum

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a greasemonkey script which provides a more or less complete 
history of all developer posts ever made on Frontier's forum regarding
Elite Dangerous.

The initial purpose was to provide a means for filtering "noise" 
(speculations) and find authoritative statements from the source.

In its current incarnation it can of course be used for other purposes,
such as easily following a specific developer or topic, like what's
been said regarding AI behavior, interesting algorithm or perhaps rules
for extracting and using data from the game.

Simply put, it's meant to save me time and effort, and if it saves you 
any, then all the better.

USAGE

SUPPORT & ENHANCEMENT

tracker.

DISCLAIMER
------------
I'm only testing the script with the latest release version of each
browser and addon/extension, so if you run into problems using other
versions, then I can't help you. You'll just have to tweak the source
yourself.
